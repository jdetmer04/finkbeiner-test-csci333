Laura Roberts

Laura Roberts, MD, professor and chair of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, has received a 2014 Distinguished Service Award from the American Psychiatric Association.

Established in 1964 by the association's board of trustees, the award honors organizations and individuals that have contributed to the field of psychiatry.

Roberts, who is also the Katharine Dexter McCormick and Stanley McCormick Memorial Professor in the School of Medicine, is best known for her work on ethical issues and public policy relating to both clinical care and research science.

Her research has been praised for providing valuable evidence to help resolve complex and controversial issues in health policy related to vulnerable populations. Since 2003, she has been editor-in-chief of Academic Psychiatry, a journal focused on education, mentorship and leadership in academic psychiatry.

"This is a great honor for Dr. Roberts and a fitting recognition of her dedication and outstanding contributions to the field," said Lloyd Minor, MD, dean of the medical school. "All of us at Stanford Medicine are very proud of her achievements."
