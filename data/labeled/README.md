# Labeling Guidelines

## Finkbeiner Score: 0-4 Scale
0 = Perfectly neutral (focuses solely on research)
1 = Minor gender mention (e.g., "Dr. Smith, a woman...")
2 = Moderate bias (unnecessary personal details)
3 = Strong bias (stereotypes about childcare, nurturing, 'first woman')
4 = Severe bias (focus is on gender, not science)

## Violation Categories
- The fact that she’s a woman
- Her husband’s job
- Her child-care arrangements
- How she nurtures her underlings
- How she was taken aback by the competitiveness in her field
- How she’s such a role model for other women
- How she’s the “first woman to…”
