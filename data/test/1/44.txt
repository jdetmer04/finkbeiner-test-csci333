Carla Shatz

Carla Shatz, PhD, the Sapp Family Provostial Professor and professor of biology and neurobiology, has been awarded the Mortimer D. Sackler, MD, Prize for Distinguished Achievement in Developmental Psychobiology.

The award is given every two years by the Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and the Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology at Weill Cornell Medical College.

The award recognizes researchers who have "advanced our understanding of the developmental processes of mind, brain and behavior that contribute to normal development and of the origins of mental illness." It honors Sackler, the late psychiatrist and research pioneer in biological psychiatry.

Shatz's research focuses on how the brain changes with learning, especially during early developmental periods. Her research has relevance not only for understanding brain wiring and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, dyslexia and schizophrenia, but also for understanding how the nervous and immune systems interact.

Shatz was chosen for her pioneering work and also for her leadership in the field of neuroscience and her track record of mentorship. She was the first woman to earn a PhD in neurobiology at Harvard, as well as the first woman to receive tenure at Stanford in the basic sciences. Today, she serves as director of Stanford's Bio-X program, which supports, organizes and facilitates interdisciplinary research connected to biology and medicine.
